# Assignment Instructions

Create a short one level game or interactive vignette, with aesthetics, mechanics and/or themes that you would argue go "against the grain" of the Unity* engine (for this assignment Unreal, Gamemaker, Godot, or a comparable major GPE are appropriate alternatives, upon instructor approval). 

For this project, you can work individually or in groups of up to five (5). You can develop the game for any platform you like. Your game can be in 2D or 3D, and should be designed to complete in less than 5 minutes. Gameplay demos (5 minutes of gameplay with no defined end goal) are acceptable.

Your individual postmortem/reflection (5 points) should include a brief description of how your work meets the criteria of going against the grain of your chosen engine. You must identify a specific way in which you are working against the grain, and explain how it influences specific and substantive experiential or gameplay elements, in your original work. This need not be longer than 1-2 paragraphs.
